Assembly Instructions.

Panel thermocouple (397-1567).
The thermocouple is plugged with a 3m approx red cable red shield to a max31855 based board.
Warning: 
	Blue internal conductor is joined to positive pole (+)    
	White internal conductor is joined to negative pole (-)


Environment thermocouple (TME 409-4908)
The thermocouple is plugged with twisted pair green/white to a max31855 based board.
Warning: 
	White conductor is joined to positive pole (+)    
	Green conductor is joined to negative pole (-)


The two max31855 based board must be connected to Arduino digital input and to power (Vcc 5V) and ground.
Pins used on each board are: 

Vin
GND
DO
CS
CLK
Pin 3Vo is unused 


Input used in Arduino sketch for board controlling Panel thermocouple:
DO = 23;
CS = 25;
CLK = 27;

Input used in Arduino sketch for board controlling Environment thermocouple:
DO = 22;
CS = 24;
CLK = 26;

If you need to change Pin, you must change in Arduino sketch the following lines:

//THERMOCOUPLE AMBIENT CONST
const int THERMO_ENV_DO = 22;
const int THERMO_ENV_CS = 24;
const int THERMO_ENV_CLK =26;

//THERMOCOUPLE AMBIENT CONST
const int THERMO_ENV_DO = 22;
const int THERMO_ENV_CS = 24;
const int THERMO_ENV_CLK =26;



//THERMOCOUPLE PANEL CONST
const int THERMO_PANEL_DO = 23;//10
const int THERMO_PANEL_CS = 25;//8
const int THERMO_PANEL_CLK = 27;//9
